APCS
L02 -- Well Al B. Sorted
2021-12-10
time spent:  1.0 hours
DISCO:
- It is helpful to override the toString method to print the array list because it helps us tell if it is sorted or not.
- We did not need to change the remove method because it does not make the list not sorted.
- By comparing the values of the inputted element and the elements in the list, we can place the input into the appropriate index.
QCC:
- How else can we manipulate a list?
- How can we search the list faster and more efficiently?
