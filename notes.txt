APCS
L02 -- Well Al B. Sorted
2021-12-10
time spent:  0.5 hours
DISCO:
- It is helpful to override the toString method to print the array list because it helps us tell if it is sorted or not.
- We did not need to change the remove method because it does not make the list not sorted. 
QCC:
- How else can we manipulate a list?
